# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: [Insert Date]_

Pocket Rate respects your privacy. We believe your data should stay yours — always.

## 🔒 Data Collection

We **do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data**. All data entered into the Pocket Rate app — including your expenses, budgets, and currency preferences — is stored **locally on your device**.

We do not use third-party analytics, trackers, or cloud backups. Your information remains **completely offline and private**.

## 🌐 Internet Usage

Pocket Rate only connects to the internet when you manually update currency exchange rates. These updates are anonymous and no identifying information is sent or received.

## 👀 Your Control

Since all your data is stored locally, **you have full control**. Deleting the app will also delete all your stored data. No one — including us — can access or recover it.
